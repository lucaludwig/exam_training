QUESTION NO: 82
An ML engineer is training an ML model to identify people's health risk based on 20 features
and
1 target. The target class has two values:
- Likely to have health risk (positive class)
- Unlikely to have health risk (negative class)
The age range of people in the dataset is 30 years old to 60 years old. Age is one of the
features.
The ML engineer analyzes the features. For the positive class, the difference in proportions
of labels (DPL) value is (+0.9) for the age range of 40 to 45 compared with all other age
ranges.
What should the ML engineer do to correct this data imbalance?
A. Oversample the positive class for the age range of 40 to 45.
B. Undersample the positive class for the age range of 40 to 45.
C. Undersample the positive class for all age ranges except 40 to 45.
D. Oversample the negative class for all age ranges except 40 to 45.
Answer: B
Explanation:
A DPL of +0.9 indicates that the positive class is heavily overrepresented in the 40-45 age
range compared to other age ranges. To correct this imbalance, the solution is to
undersample the positive class within the 40-45 range, reducing its dominance and improving
fairness in the dataset.

QUESTION NO: 83
A data scientist is working on optimizing a model during the training process by varying

37

IT Certification Guaranteed, The Easy Way!

multiple parameters. The data scientist observes that, during multiple runs with identical
parameters, the loss function converges to different, yet stable, values.
What should the data scientist do to improve the training process?
A. Increase the learning rate. Keep the batch size the same.
B. Decrease the learning rate. Reduce the batch size.
C. Decrease the learning rate. Keep the batch size the same.
D. Do not change the learning rate. Increase the batch size.
Answer: B
Explanation:
It is most likely that the loss function is very curvy and has multiple local minima where the
training is getting stuck. Decreasing the batch size would help the data scientist stochastically
get out of the local minima saddles. Decreasing the learning rate would prevent overshooting
the global loss function minimum.

QUESTION NO: 84
A company wants to use Amazon SageMaker to host an ML model that runs on CPU for realtime predictions. The model will have intermittent traffic during business hours and will have
periods of no traffic after business hours. The company needs a solution that will serve
inference requests in the most cost-effective manner. Which hosting option will meet these
requirements?
A. Deploy the model to a SageMaker real-time endpoint. Add a schedule-based auto scaling
policy to handle traffic surges during business hours.
B. Deploy the model to a SageMaker Serverless Inference endpoint. Configure increased
provisioned concurrency during business hours.
C. Deploy the model to a SageMaker Asynchronous Inference endpoint. Configure an auto
scaling policy that scales in to zero outside business hours.
D. Deploy the model to a SageMaker real-time endpoint. Create a scheduled AWS Lambda
function that activates the endpoint during business hours only.
Answer: B
Explanation:
SageMaker Serverless Inference is the most cost-effective option for models with intermittent
traffic. It automatically scales down to zero when idle, so no cost is incurred outside business
hours. Configuring provisioned concurrency during business hours ensures low-latency
responses when traffic is expected.

models in the SageMaker Model Registry.
D. Import the Python-based models into SageMaker. Rebuild the scikit-learn and TensorFlow
models in SageMaker. Register all the models in the SageMaker Model Registry.
Answer: D
Explanation:
The least operational overhead comes from directly importing the scikit-learn and TensorFlow
models into SageMaker, rebuilding them using the respective prebuilt SageMaker
frameworks, and then registering them in the SageMaker Model Registry. This leverages
managed framework containers provided by SageMaker, avoids custom container
management, and integrates seamlessly with the registry.
